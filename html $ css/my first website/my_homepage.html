	     <h3 id="c1">About Rafa</h3>
		 <p>Rafael "Rafa" Nadal is a Spanish professional tennis player. 
		 He is widely regarded as the greatest clay-court player in history and owing to his dominance and success on the surface,
		 he has been titled "The King of Clay". His evolution into an all-court threat has established him as one of the greatest 
		 players in tennis history with some considering Nadal to be the greatest player of all time. </p>
		 <p>
         Born in Spain in 1986, Rafael Nadal began playing tennis at age 3 and turned pro at 15. At the age of 8, Nadal won an 
		 under-12 regional tennis championship, giving Uncle Toni the incentive to step up his training. Toni noticed at the time 
		 that Rafael played his forehand shots with two hands, so he encouraged him to play left-handed, thinking it could give 
		 Rafael an edge on the court. When Nadal was just 12 years old, he won the Spanish and European tennis titles in his age group. 
		 He turned professional at age 15. Known for his topspin-heavy shots and tenacity, he claimed the first of a record nine 
		 French Open singles titles in 2005, and competed the career Golden Slam by winning the U.S. Open in 2010. Sidelined by a 
		 knee injury in 2012, Nadal rebounded to win two more major championships in 2013</p>

	  <div id="History">
	     <h3 id="c2">Historic Achievements</h3>
		 <p>Nadal won five straight French Open singles titles from 2010 to 2014 to become the only player in this event to win five 
		 consecutive single titles. Earlier he had captured four straight French Open singles titles from 2005 to 2008 joining Paul 
		 Aymé and Björn Borg as the only other man to have won four consecutive singles titles there; in 2014, by winning his ninth 
		 French Open title, Nadal became the only male to win nine major titles at a grand slam event, equaling Martina Navratilova's 
		 nine at Wimbledon. If a criteria to judge greatness is based on performance against top players then Nadal would come out to be the greatest. 
		 He has played 24 matches against Federer & Djokovic in Grand Slams and he leads 18-6. (9-2 vs Federer & 9-4 vs Djokovic).</p>
		 <p>
		 In 2008, Nadal became the second Spanish man to win Wimbledon. Nadal is only the third male player in the open era to have won 
		 the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year, and the first since Borg in 1980. In 2009, Nadal became the first Spaniard to 
		 win the Australian Open, and the first male player to simultaneously hold Grand Slams on clay, grass and hardcourt.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 He is also the first, and only male player to date, to win three consecutive Grand Slam Tournaments on three different surfaces 
		 (clay, grass and hardcourt) in the same year (2010); and across both sexes, second only to Steffi Graf's Calendar Year Golden 
		 Slam in 1988. In 2015, Serena Williams also accomplished this feat. By winning the 2010 US Open, Nadal completed a men's singles 
		 Career Grand Slam. He is the 7th male player in history to achieve this. In addition, Nadal has accomplished the Career Golden Slam 
		 and is the 2nd male player in history to attain this after Andre Agassi. Nadal has won ATP tournaments in 19 different countries.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Nadal has won 28 ATP Masters titles second only to Djokovic 30 and has a record-tying 42 finals (tied with Federer and Djokovic) 
		 and a standalone 59 semifinals.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Nadal has been especially successful on clay courts. He has a 48-8 record in clay court tournament finals and has lost only twice 
		 in best-of-five-set matches on clay. He has won four consecutive French Open titles from 2005–08 and five consecutives from 2010–14, 
		 nine Monte-Carlo Masters and seven Rome Masters, and won at least one of the three clay court Masters Series tournaments every year 
		 between 2005 and 2014. By virtue of his 9th Monte Carlo title in 2016, Nadal became the first ATP player in history to win two different 
		 tournaments nine times each. In 2016, by virtue of winning his 9th Barcelona crown, he became the first player in the Open Era to win 3 
		 different tournaments 9 times each (also Roland Garros and Monte Carlo). He also owns the longest single-surface winning streak in the 
		 open era, having won 81 consecutive matches on clay from April 2005 to May 2007. As a result, most tennis critics and top players already 
		 regard him as the greatest clay-court player of all time. 
		 </p>

      <div id="play">
	     <h3 id="c3">Playing Style</h3>
		 <p>
		  Nadal generally plays an aggressive, behind-the-baseline game founded on heavy topspin groundstrokes, consistency, speedy footwork 
		  and tenacious court coverage, thus making him an aggressive counterpuncher. Known for his athleticism and speed around the court, 
		  Nadal is an excellent defender who hits well on the run, constructing winning plays from seemingly defensive positions. He also plays 
		  very fine drop shots, which work especially well because his heavy topspin often forces opponents to the back of the court.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		  Nadal employs a semi-western grip forehand, often with a "lasso-whip" follow through, where his left arm hits through the ball and 
		  finishes above his left shoulder – as opposed to a more traditional finish across the body or around his opposite shoulder. 
		  Nadal's forehand groundstroke form allows him to hit shots with heavy topspin – more so than many of his contemporaries.

	     <h3 id="c4">Vs Federer</h3>
		 <p>Federer and Nadal have been playing each other since 2004, and their rivalry is a significant part of both men's careers. 
		 They held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 until 14 August 2009, when Nadal fell to world No. 3 
		 (Andy Murray became the new No. 2). They are the only pair of men to have ever finished four consecutive calendar years at the top.
		 Nadal ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for a record 160 consecutive weeks before surpassing Federer in August 2008.</p>
		 <p>
		 They have played 35 times, and Nadal leads their head-to-head series 23–12 overall and 9–3 in Grand Slam tournaments. 
		 Federer has a winning record on grass (2–1) and indoor hard courts (5–1) while Nadal leads the outdoor hard courts by 8–3 and clay by 13–2.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 As tournament seedings are based on rankings, 22 of their matches have been in tournament finals, including an all-time record nine Grand 
		 Slam tournament finals.[221] From 2006 to 2008, they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final, and also met in the title match of 
		 the 2009 Australian Open, the 2011 French Open and the 2017 Australian Open. Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals. 
		 Four of these matches were five-set matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), and the 2008 Wimbledon final has been 
		 lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts. Nadal is the only player who has competed and won against Federer in the 
		 final of a Grand Slam on all three surfaces (grass, hard, and clay).
